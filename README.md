# This is a simple full-stack app

This app makes calculates maximum position discount based on it's provided values.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To run this project, you need to open two separate teminals.

## In one ternimal, cd to project directory, then follow these steps:

### run `npm install`
This will install all the dependencies. 
Although I made sure to include all the dependencies, it is possible that it might give issues with some node versions.

### If you successfully installed all the dependencies, then run `npm run dev`
This will start the back-end server on port 5001.

## In second terminal, cd to project directory, then cd to 'react-ui' folder and follow these steps:

### run `npm install`
This will install all the dependencies. 
I made sure to include all the dependencies, so there shouldn't be any major issues.

### If you successfully installed all the dependencies, then run `npm start`
This will start the react front-end server on port 3000.

It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console. But it won't effect the results.
